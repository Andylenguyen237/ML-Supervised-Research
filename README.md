# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Research

### Using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the Vitamin B12 content based on other nutritional data in Animal-based product and dishes that could helps indivisual to enhance their dietary choices, the main target for this data modelling research is the elderly, who are susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency

### About
* main.py: dataframe and models based on nutrients xlsx file, supported by different preprocessing techniques and plots
* Machine Learning Research.pdf: full research including data analysis and hypothesis made after dervied from the model and results calculated by the functions in main.py
